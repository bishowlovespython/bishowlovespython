## 🧠 Sample Code: Solving a Differential Equation with `scipy`

```python
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a simple ODE: dy/dt = -2y
def model(t, y):
    return -2 * y

solution = solve_ivp(model, [0, 5], [1], t_eval=[0.1 * i for i in range(51)])

plt.plot(solution.t, solution.y[0])
plt.title('Exponential Decay')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('y(t)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
