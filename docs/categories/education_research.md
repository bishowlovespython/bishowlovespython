# Education & Research

Python is widely embraced in education and research for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It’s an excellent language for teaching programming, computational thinking, and for conducting research across many disciplines.

## 🎓 Key Applications

- **Teaching Programming**: Introducing students to coding concepts.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Analyzing experimental or survey data.
- **Simulations & Modeling**: Running simulations in science, social science, and economics.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzing text data for linguistics or social sciences.
- **Interactive Learning**: Creating educational games and tools.
- **Publishing & Sharing**: Writing reproducible research using Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🧪 Sample Code: Plotting a Simple Graph with `matplotlib`

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

plt.plot(x, y, marker='o')
plt.title("Sample Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
