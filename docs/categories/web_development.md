# Web Development

Python is a powerful language for building modern web applications, APIs, and backend services. Its clean syntax and mature frameworks make it a popular choice for both startups and large enterprises.

## 🌐 Key Applications

- **Websites and Web Apps**: Building dynamic, database-driven websites.
- **RESTful APIs**: Creating backend services to serve data to frontend apps or mobile clients.
- **Admin Interfaces**: Rapidly creating secure dashboards for managing content and users.
- **Microservices**: Deploying modular, scalable backend services.
- **Serverless Functions**: Writing lightweight APIs for cloud platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

## ⚙️ Popular Frameworks

| Framework | Description                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Django`  | High-level, batteries-included framework for rapid development. |
| `Flask`   | Lightweight and flexible, ideal for microservices and APIs.     |
| `FastAPI` | High-performance API framework with automatic docs via OpenAPI. |
| `Tornado` | Scalable, non-blocking web server and framework.                |
| `Bottle`  | Simple micro-framework for small applications.                  |

## 🧩 Key Features of Python Web Frameworks

- URL routing and view handling
- Template rendering (e.g., with Jinja2)
- Form validation and user authentication
- ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for database access
- Middleware and session management
- Integration with frontend frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)

## 🛠️ Common Tools & Libraries

| Tool         | Use Case                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `Jinja2`     | HTML templating engine                 |
| `SQLAlchemy` | Database ORM for flexible SQL access   |
| `Alembic`    | Database migrations                    |
| `Gunicorn`   | Production WSGI server for Python apps |
| `Uvicorn`    | ASGI server for async frameworks       |
| `WTForms`    | Form validation                        |
| `requests`   | HTTP requests (often for APIs)         |

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Blogging platforms with admin interfaces (e.g., using Django)
- RESTful APIs for mobile or SPA frontends (e.g., using FastAPI)
- E-commerce websites with carts, checkouts, and user accounts
- Personal portfolios or static sites with dynamic backends
- Authentication systems with OAuth or JWT
