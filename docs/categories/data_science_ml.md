# Data Science & Machine Learning

Python is the leading language in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning due to its simplicity, powerful libraries, and large community support.

## 🔍 Key Applications

- **Data Analysis**: Handling, cleaning, and exploring large datasets using tools like `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative and interactive visualizations using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- **Machine Learning**: Training models for classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation using `scikit-learn`.
- **Deep Learning**: Building neural networks for image processing, NLP, and more using frameworks like `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, and `PyTorch`.
- **Big Data Integration**: Interfacing with tools like `PySpark`, `Dask`, and `Hadoop` for distributed computing.
- **Model Deployment**: Serving ML models via APIs using `Flask`, `FastAPI`, or cloud services.
